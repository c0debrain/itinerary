###Local development

- Nothing fancy required to start the server, just `cd` into the project directory and fire up `meteor`
- Using [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for SASS: bundle install and ensure that any changes to the SCSS files are compiled with `compass compile` or `compass watch`
- Learn how to [debug on the server-side](https://coderwall.com/p/eqecca) (useful for debugging some Meteor methods and callbacks)
